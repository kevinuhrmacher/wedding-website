#### Getting to D.C. 
We suggest arriving at DCA (Reagan National Airport), which is only a 5-10 minute drive and both hotels have shuttles that will pick you up from there. Other airports — IAD (Dulles) and BWI (Baltimore) — will require more travel to get to the hotels in Old Town Alexandria.


#### Rental car
If you’re renting a car for your visit, we recommend taking the shuttle from DCA (Reagan National Airport) to the Sheraton and renting the car at the Enterprise location on-site. This will be less expensive than doing it at the airport.


#### Wedding hotel blocks
There will be two hotel options. 

Let us know if you run into any problems when booking!

#### A note on the Metro

You’re going to get the real D.C. experience in that D.C.’s train, the Metro, [will not be operating quite as we’d hoped](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/metro-wants-to-rebuild-20-station-platforms-in-three-years-creating-safetrack-like-disruptions/2018/05/07/f7c19dcc-5164-11e8-abd8-265bd07a9859_story.html) during the wedding weekend. Right now it looks like your best bet is to take the Yellow or Blue Line to the Airport and then take the hotel shuttle from there. Uber, Lyft and water taxi are also good options.
