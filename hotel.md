#### Wedding hotel blocks
There will be two hotel options in historic [Old Town Alexandria](https://www.visitalexandriava.com/old-town-alexandria/), just south of D.C. A block away from one another, they are 5-10 minutes from Reagan National Airport and 15-20 minutes from Mount Vernon. From the hotel you’ll be a short walk or shuttle ride from the shops and restaurants on King Street and the waterfront.

Let us know if you run into any problems when booking your hotel rooms!

#### Flying to D.C. 
We suggest arriving at Reagan National Airport (DCA), which is a 5-10 minute drive. Both hotels have shuttles from there. Other airports — Dulles (IAD) and Baltimore (BWI) — will require considerably more travel to get to Old Town.


#### Rental car
If you’re renting a car for your visit, we recommend taking the shuttle from DCA (Reagan National Airport) to the Sheraton and renting the car at the Enterprise location on-site. This will be less expensive than doing it at the airport.

#### A note on the Metro

Unfortunately, the Metro [will not be operating quite as we’d hoped](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/metro-wants-to-rebuild-20-station-platforms-in-three-years-creating-safetrack-like-disruptions/2018/05/07/f7c19dcc-5164-11e8-abd8-265bd07a9859_story.html) during the wedding weekend. Your best bet to get to D.C. is probably to take the hotel shuttle to Reagan National Airport and get on the Yellow or Blue Line there.
