# _Our wedding registry_

As we look forward to beginning our life together, we have created a registry to help friends and family looking for gift suggestions. For most kitchen items, [**we’ve registered at Hill’s Kitchen,**](https://www.hillskitchen.com/registry/schmidt-uhrmacher/){:target="_blank"} a local shop on Capitol Hill. In addition, [**our registry on The Knot**](https://registry.theknot.com/-/30737374){:target="_blank"} includes household items from Target and Pottery Barn, as well as honeymoon experiences.
