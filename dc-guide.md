_Kevin:_ The Air & Space Museum on the Mall is one of the most visited museums in the world. But did you know that it has a second location about 40 minutes away in Virginia? The **Udvar-Hazy Center** at Dulles Airport has lots to look at: the TK space shuttle, the Enola Gay, TK TK. Plus, they have an IMAX theater and flight simulators that allow you to take the role of pilot or gunner in an F-16. 

If you’re looking for something closer, try the Newseum, the new Police Memorial Museum, the Bible Museum or the American History Museum.
